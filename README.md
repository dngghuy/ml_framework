Notes:

Things to do when approaching a ML problem with tabular data:

    - Exploratory analysis on jupyter notebook in `exploration`
    
    - Modifying `dispatcher.py`: data paths, models settings, other fixed settings.
    
    - Modifying `feature_generator.py`: Crafting different versions of feature engineering pipelines.
    
    - Modifying `train.py`: Adding other settings, e.g., adding visualization?
